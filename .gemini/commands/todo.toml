prompt = """
Please list all current TODO's and sort them from most to least important.
The list should be a bullet list with emoji and/or markdown coordination for each section (most importance, medium importance, least importance).
Distinguish the file name and line number from the actual TODO text clearly by coloring the first part. Keep all the text in english.

Follow these commands when performing the TODO search:

FindFiles '**/*.{ts,tsx}'

ReadManyFiles on all found files

Look for TODO on all read files
