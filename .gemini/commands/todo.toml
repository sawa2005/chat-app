description="Lists current TODO's and sorts from most to least important"
prompt = """
Please list all current TODO's and sort them from most to least important.
The list should be a bullet list with emoji and/or markdown coordination for each section (most importance, medium importance, least importance).
Distinguish the file name and line number from the actual TODO text clearly by coloring the first part. Keep all the text in english.

Follow these commands when performing the TODO search:

1. Find all relevant files: Use the glob tool to find all files with the extensions (.ts, .tsx).
2. Read all found files: Use the read_many_files tool to get the complete content of
   all the files found in the previous step.
3. Find all occurences of TODO: in the read_many_files result and list them according to the previous instructions.
